# AUR Helper Py

`AUR Helper Py` is another AUR helper for you, not full feature rich just does one thing and that is to download the correct package, for search it uses the `Aurweb RPC interface`.

Then there is just some simple python, although it is still in development you can use it, but i highly recommend to not use it, because as i said it's not completely built yet.

## This is how you can run it
